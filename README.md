##  Note:
With the relevant functions of eye-tracking, user calibration is preferred. The Tobii User Calibration application has been preset in the ROM of Pico Neo2 Eye devices, as shown in the red box below. At present, automatic recognition of eye calibration data is not supported, so this operation is required when changing users.
